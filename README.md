# Calorie Remover

A Firefox extension hides calorie labels on the British food delivery website Deliveroo.

### About

In 2019, Deliveroo began adding calorie labelling for menu items on its platform. While this was a generally a positive move for consumers looking to make healthier food choices, calorie labelling like this can be triggering for those struggling with or in recovery from disordered eating.

This extension will automatically hide all calorie labelling information from view in a Firefox browser.

_This extension is currently in the testing phase. The goal is to submit it to Firefox for publishing in the coming weeks._

### Try It Out!

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open Firefox. In the address bar, go to [about:debugging](about:debugging).
3. On the left side, select "This Firefox".
4. Under "Temporary Extensions", click the "Load Temporary Add-on" button.
5. Select the file called "calorieRemover.js".
6. It should fill in an extension called "Calorie Remover". This will work for as long as your browser is open. If you close out, you'll need to redo steps 3-6 to keep the extension.
7. To stop running the extension, click "Remove" on that same about:debugging page.
